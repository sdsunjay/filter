# Filter
A Filter that removes stop words, replaces links, emotes, and locations, and does stemming

## Background
This work was originally apart of [SPOONS](http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&context=csse_fac) by [Eriq Augustine](https://github.com/eriq-augustine) & co. It was used use to filter movie titles out of tweets. However, I am using it to filter cities out of Facebook posts as part of my [ridesharing work](https://github.com/sdsunjay/rideshare). It can also be used in a more generalize way to filter any special words from any large or small texts. You just need to specify the filename to read the stop words from and the filename to read the text from in EriqFilter.java
